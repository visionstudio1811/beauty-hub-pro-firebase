# Beauty Hub Pro — Claude Code Guide

## Project Overview

Beauty Hub Pro is a multi-tenant salon and spa management platform. It handles appointments, client records, staff, treatments, packages, products, waivers, marketing campaigns, and Acuity Scheduling sync.

This project was migrated from Supabase to Firebase. All data lives in Firestore; all backend logic runs in Cloud Functions.

**Firebase project:** `beauty-hub-pro-app`
**GitHub:** https://github.com/visionstudio1811/beauty-hub-pro-firebase

## Commands

### Frontend
```bash
npm run dev       # Start dev server on port 8080
npm run build     # Production build → dist/
npm run preview   # Preview the built app
npm run lint      # ESLint
```

### Cloud Functions
```bash
cd functions
npm run build       # Compile TypeScript → lib/
npm run build:watch # Watch mode
```

### Firebase
```bash
npx firebase-tools@latest deploy                         # Deploy everything (hosting + functions + firestore)
npx firebase-tools@latest deploy --only hosting:app      # App only (React build in dist/)
npx firebase-tools@latest deploy --only functions
npx firebase-tools@latest deploy --only firestore        # rules + indexes together
npx firebase-tools@latest deploy --only firestore:rules
npx firebase-tools@latest deploy --only firestore:indexes
npx firebase-tools@latest emulators:start                # Run all emulators locally
```

**After editing `firestore.rules` or `firestore.indexes.json`, always deploy.** The repo state is not the deployed state — a rules file that's only on disk grants nothing, and a new multi-field query will fail until its index is deployed and built.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values from the Firebase Console (Project Settings → Your apps → Web app):

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=beauty-hub-pro-app.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=beauty-hub-pro-app
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=beauty-hub-pro-app.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

Cloud Function secrets (set once via CLI, stored in Secret Manager):
```bash
firebase functions:secrets:set RESEND_API_KEY       # sendWaiver, sendClientEmail, notifyOrgOnWaiverSigned
firebase functions:secrets:set ACUITY_API_USER_ID   # acuitySync
firebase functions:secrets:set ACUITY_API_KEY       # acuitySync
```

Per-org credentials (Twilio SMS creds, org-specific Resend API keys, Acuity webhook secret) live in each org's `marketingIntegrations` or `acuitySyncConfig` subcollection, not Secret Manager. Rules restrict read/write to org admins.

---

## Firestore Data Model

All organization data lives under `organizations/{orgId}/` sub-collections. This enforces multi-tenant isolation at the path level and mirrors security rules.

```
users/{uid}                          ← user profiles (role, organizationId)
organizations/{orgId}                ← org document
  /clients/{id}
  /appointments/{id}
  /staff/{id}
  /treatments/{id}
  /packages/{id}
  /purchases/{id}
  /products/{id}
  /productAssignments/{id}
  /businessHours/{id}
  /config/businessInfo               ← single-document config
  /schedulingConfig/{id}
  /dropdownData/{id}
  /waiverTemplates/{id}
  /clientWaivers/{id}
  /clientCommunications/{id}
  /auditLogs/{id}                    ← written by Cloud Functions only
  /marketingCampaigns/{id}
  /marketingTemplates/{id}
  /marketingAutomations/{id}
  /campaignRecipients/{id}
  /marketingIntegrations/{id}        ← stores Resend/Twilio API keys (admin-only, get-only, no list)
  /acuitySyncConfig/{id}             ← includes per-org Acuity `webhook_secret`
  /acuitySyncLogs/{id}
  /rateLimits/{action_YYYYMMDD}      ← Cloud-Function-only per-org daily counters
  /invoices/{id}                     ← immutable invoice records (CF-only create; admin one-time pdf_url update)
  /config/invoiceCounter             ← per-org sequential counter (CF-only writes)
waiverTokens/{token}                 ← unauthenticated waiver signing (get-only, no list; 30-day TTL via expiresAt)
```

---

## Authentication Flow

1. User signs in with email/password (`signInWithEmail`) or Google (`signInWithGoogle`) — both live in `AuthContext`.
2. `onAuthStateChanged` fires → `AuthContext` loads user profile from `users/{uid}` via Firestore `getDoc`.
3. Profile contains `organizationId` and `role` used for all subsequent access control.
4. `signOut` calls `firebaseSignOut` **and** `queryClient.clear()` so cached tenant data does not leak to the next user on a shared device.

New user accounts are created exclusively by the `adminCreateUser` Cloud Function (Admin SDK bypasses rules). The client-side login error is a single generic "Invalid email or password" regardless of Firebase's specific code — do not expand this, it exists to prevent account enumeration.

Auth is in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`. Use `useAuth()` for `user`, `profile`, `signOut`, `signInWithEmail`, `signInWithGoogle`, `refreshProfile`.

---

## Role-Based Access Control

Roles: `admin` | `staff` | `reception` | `beautician`

Permission matrix:
- **admin** — full access to everything
- **staff** — clients, appointments, treatments, packages, products
- **reception** — view clients/appointments, manage appointments
- **beautician** — view clients, appointments, treatments

Role is stored in `users/{uid}.role` in Firestore and enforced both:
- **Client-side:** via `useSecurityValidation` hook and `RoleProtectedRoute`
- **Server-side:** via `firestore.rules` (reads `users/{uid}` on every guarded operation)

---

## Context Providers

Each domain has a React context provider. They are stacked in `App.tsx`:

| Context | Hook | What it manages |
|---|---|---|
| `AuthContext` | `useAuth()` | Firebase user + Firestore profile |
| `OrganizationContext` | `useOrganization()` | Current org, org list, switching |
| `ClientsContext` | `useClients()` | Client list for current org |
| `AppointmentContext` | `useAppointments()` | Appointments |
| `StaffContext` | `useStaff()` | Staff members |
| `TreatmentContext` | `useTreatments()` | Treatments |
| `PackageContext` | `usePackages()` | Packages |
| `BusinessHoursContext` | `useBusinessHours()` | Operating hours |
| `SchedulingConfigContext` | `useSchedulingConfig()` | Appointment slot config |
| `DropdownDataContext` | `useDropdownData()` | Reference data (categories, etc.) |

---

## Cloud Functions

All functions use Firebase Functions **v2 API** (`firebase-functions/v2/https`). Import pattern:

```typescript
import { onCall, HttpsError } from 'firebase-functions/v2/https';
import { onRequest } from 'firebase-functions/v2/https';
```

Callable functions receive a `CallableRequest` — access data via `request.data`, auth via `request.auth`.

| Function | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `adminCreateUser` | `onCall` | Admin-only user creation (Auth + Firestore doc) |
| `sendClientEmail` | `onCall` | Send email via Resend; per-org daily rate limit |
| `sendWaiver` | `onCall` | Send waiver link via SMS/email/device; issues a 30-day TTL token; per-org daily rate limit |
| `notifyOrgOnWaiverSigned` | `onDocumentUpdated` | Firestore trigger: emails org admins the signed PDF + photos |
| `acuitySync` | `onCall` | Manual Acuity Scheduling sync |
| `acuityWebhook` | `onRequest` | Acuity webhook receiver (HMAC-verified with per-org `webhook_secret`) |
| `packageExpiryNotifications` | scheduled | Periodic reminders for expiring packages |
| `createInvoice` | `onCall` | Admin-only invoice generation; atomic counter + frozen snapshots + computed totals; idempotent per `purchase_id`; rate-limited 100/day |
| `voidInvoice` | `onCall` | Admin-only; flips an issued invoice's status to `void` and stamps `voided_at` / `voided_by`. Idempotent via `failed-precondition` on an already-voided invoice; rate-limited 50/day. Invoice numbers never reused. |

All callables validate `request.auth` + verify the caller's `users/{uid}.organizationId` matches `request.data.organizationId` and check role before doing work. Rate-limited actions use `consumeRateLimit(orgId, action, limit)` from `rateLimit.ts` — never skip this on new functions that spend external budget (Twilio, Resend).

---

## Key Patterns

### Querying Firestore
Always filter by `organizationId` — current org comes from `useOrganization()`:
```typescript
const { currentOrganization } = useOrganization();
const q = query(
  collection(db, 'organizations', currentOrganization.id, 'clients'),
  where('deletedAt', '==', null),
  orderBy('name')
);
```

### Calling Cloud Functions
```typescript
import { httpsCallable } from 'firebase/functions';
import { functions } from '@/lib/firebase';

const sendEmail = httpsCallable(functions, 'sendClientEmail');
await sendEmail({ to, subject, message, clientId, organizationId });
```

### Soft deletes
Clients use soft deletes — set `deletedAt` field instead of deleting the document. Always filter `where('deletedAt', '==', null)` in active client queries.

### Data sanitization
All data from Firestore passes through `src/lib/dataSanitization.ts` before being used in the UI. Don't skip this.

### Date formatting
All date rendering goes through `safeFormatters` from `src/lib/safeDateFormatter.ts` (`shortDate`, `longDate`, `monthYear`, `dayMonth`). The underlying `validateDate` in `src/lib/timeUtils.ts` accepts **Firestore Timestamps, Dates, ISO strings, and numeric millis** and returns a real `Date` or `null`. Do not call `new Date(x).toLocaleDateString()` directly on anything that may be a Firestore Timestamp — `new Date(timestamp)` produces "Invalid Date". On invalid input, `safeFormatters` returns `''`; render `' || '—'` in the JSX so empty fields display a dash instead of nothing.

### Client aggregates (Clients page)
The Clients page stats — **Total Revenue**, **VIP Clients**, and the per-row **Visits** / **Revenue** / **Last Visit** columns — are computed in `src/hooks/usePaginatedClients.ts`. One parallel fetch pulls clients + completed appointments + active/completed purchases, then joins them by `client_id` in memory. `totalVisits` = count of completed appointments; `totalRevenue` = sum of `purchases.total_amount`; `lastVisit` = most recent `appointment_date`. If you add a new revenue source (e.g. standalone product sales), add it to the aggregation here so every downstream consumer sees the same number.

**VIP** is defined as `has_membership === true`. If the business wants a richer definition (e.g. lifetime revenue threshold), change `ClientStatsCards.tsx` — but keep the aggregation input in `usePaginatedClients`.

### Membership status — derived, not stored
The `client.has_membership` boolean in Firestore is user-editable, but **display** of membership status (e.g. the Membership tab's "Active/Inactive" card) must be derived from the live active-purchases count, not the flag. `MembershipHistoryTab.tsx` shows `Active` iff `activePurchasesCount > 0`. This prevents the "Inactive but 1 Active Package" desync that happens when the flag isn't synced to purchase lifecycle. The flag is still useful as a manual override for Vagaro-imported clients without a matching purchase record.

### Field naming — snake_case vs camelCase
The codebase has two naming conventions, left over from the Supabase → Firebase migration. Honor the convention already used by the collection; do not mix.

- **snake_case** (migrated-from-Supabase hooks): `appointments` (`appointment_date`, `appointment_time`), `treatments` (`is_active`, `category`), `staff` (`is_active`, `name`), `dropdownData` (`is_active`, `sort_order`, `category`, `value`), `schedulingConfig` (`is_active`, `day_of_week`, `start_time`), `purchases` (`client_id`, `payment_status`), `productAssignments` (`client_id`, `assigned_at`), `clients` (`deleted_at`, `created_at`), `businessHours` (`day_of_week`), session docs (`session_token`, `created_at`, `is_active`).
- **camelCase** (newer code): `users` (`isActive`, `fullName`, `organizationId`, `organizationRole`, `createdAt`), `organizations` (`isActive`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`).

When you add a multi-field query, check the collection's existing field names first, then add the matching index to `firestore.indexes.json`. Wrong case = empty results with no error.

## Routes

```
/                     Public landing page
/auth                 Login / sign up
/waiver/:token        Public waiver signing (no auth required)
/admin                Dashboard (requires auth + organization)
/admin/appointments   Appointments
/admin/clients        Active clients
/admin/clients/trash  Deleted clients
/admin/marketing      Marketing campaigns
/admin/settings       Settings (admin or staff role only)
*                     404
```

Route guards: `ProtectedRoute` → `OrganizationProtectedRoute` → `RoleProtectedRoute`

---

## Security Invariants

These were hardened in the 2026-04-21 audit pass. Do not weaken any of them without explicit discussion.

- **`users/{uid}` field immutability.** `role`, `email`, `uid`, `createdAt` are **never** writable from the client. `organizationId` is write-once (null → value); it can never be *changed* from the client. Role/org changes must go through an admin Cloud Function. `allow create` on `/users` is `false` — only `adminCreateUser` (Admin SDK) makes user docs.
- **Tenant-subcollection writes are split** `create` / `update` / `delete`. Clients, purchases, communications, membership history are *never* hard-deletable. Prefer soft-delete via `deleted_at` for clients.
- **`waiverTokens`**: `allow get: true / list: false`. Tokens are not enumerable. They carry `expiresAt` (30 days); both the client and rules check it. Unauthenticated signing of a `clientWaivers` doc requires a valid, pending, unexpired `waiverTokens` entry whose `waiverId` + `organizationId` match the path. Do not loosen this — it is the only thing stopping arbitrary orgId/waiverId enumeration on the public form.
- **`marketingIntegrations`**: `get` only, `list` denied. These docs store third-party API keys (Twilio, Resend). Never add a list query.
- **`auditLogs`, `acuitySyncLogs`, `campaignRecipients`, `rateLimits`**: `allow write: if false`. These are written exclusively via the Admin SDK.
- **Storage `waivers/`**: size + MIME enforced in `storage.rules`. PDFs only on the top-level path; images under `/{token}/photos/`. Default deny elsewhere.
- **Callable functions**: always check `request.auth`, load the caller's `users/{uid}`, verify `organizationId` + role, then call `consumeRateLimit(org, action, limit)` before side-effects that cost money (SMS/email/external API).
- **Webhook endpoints** (`acuityWebhook`): HMAC-verify the signature with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` **before** processing payload. Each org must configure its own `webhook_secret` in `acuitySyncConfig`.
- **Invoices**: `create: false` (CF-only), `delete: false` (audit trail), `update` allows admins to set **only** `pdf_url` + `pdf_storage_path` and only while `pdf_url` is currently `null`. All monetary fields + snapshots are frozen at issue time. Invoice numbers are per-org sequential (`INV-00001`), managed by `createInvoice`. Gaps are expected (voided invoices don't renumber).
- **`config/invoiceCounter`**: `write: if false` at rule level (via `configId != 'invoiceCounter'` exclusion in the general config rule). Only the `createInvoice` Admin-SDK Cloud Function may increment it.
- **Storage `invoices/{orgId}/`**: admin-only read + write, PDFs only, 5MB cap.

## Do Not Change

- `src/components/ui/` — shadcn/ui components, regenerate with `shadcn` CLI if needed
- `tailwind.config.ts` — design tokens
- `src/lib/dataSanitization.ts` — data cleaning logic, changes here affect the whole app
- `src/lib/validation.ts` — Zod schemas used across forms
- `firestore.rules` / `storage.rules` — security rules, test with the emulator before deploying

---

## Hosting & Domains

One Firebase Hosting site (`beauty-hub-pro-app`) serves every domain. The React SPA handles both marketing and app routing — hostname determines what the root `/` route shows.

### Domain model (white-label SaaS)

| Domain | Root `/` behavior | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `beautyhubpro.com` | Renders `PublicHome` (marketing) | SaaS marketing / public landing |
| `www.beautyhubpro.com` | Renders `PublicHome` (marketing) | Same as apex |
| `app.beautyhubpro.com` | Redirects to `/auth` | CRM login under the Beauty Hub Pro brand |
| `crm.lumiereut.com` | Redirects to `/auth` | CRM login under **Lumière's brand** (white-label) |
| Future `crm.<any-brand>.com` | Redirects to `/auth` | Any future white-label client |

The host check lives in `src/pages/Index.tsx`: `app.beautyhubpro.com` and any `crm.*` host skip `PublicHome` to prevent marketing-brand leak on white-label domains. All white-label client domains MUST follow the `crm.<brand>.com` convention so this check keeps working.

Every domain serves the exact same React app against the same Firestore data — the white-label effect is purely the URL bar + the hostname-gated Index behavior.

### Adding a new white-label client domain

1. Firebase Console → Hosting → `beauty-hub-pro-app` site → Add custom domain → `crm.theirbrand.com`.
2. Give the client the A / CNAME records Firebase shows. They set them at their own registrar.
3. Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains → add `crm.theirbrand.com`. Without this, Google sign-in fails with `auth/unauthorized-domain`.
4. Wait 15min–2h for SSL cert issuance, test in incognito.
5. Confirm the domain uses the `crm.` prefix — the `isAppOnlyHost` check in `src/pages/Index.tsx` hides marketing on `crm.*` hosts. A non-conforming subdomain (e.g., `app.theirbrand.com`) would leak the Beauty Hub Pro marketing page.

### DNS gotcha — Cloudflare Proxy must be OFF

For any domain routed through Cloudflare (including our apex `beautyhubpro.com` and `app.beautyhubpro.com`), the DNS records **must** be set to "DNS only" (grey cloud), not "Proxied" (orange cloud). Proxy mode breaks Firebase's automatic cert renewal — the site keeps working for ~90 days on Cloudflare's Universal SSL, then silently fails when Firebase's own cert expires without being renewable. Flip to DNS only once, then forget about it.

Firebase requires **two A records** on the apex for redundancy: `199.36.158.100` and `199.36.158.101`.

## Manual Firebase Console Setup Required

These cannot be done via CLI and must be completed in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/beauty-hub-pro-app):

1. **Enable Email/Password and Google providers** → Authentication → Sign-in methods
2. **Add authorized domains** → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains (add production domain)
3. **Firestore location** — set to `us-central1` during init
4. **Storage** — enabled; bucket is `beauty-hub-pro-app.appspot.com`. Rules are managed via `storage.rules` in the repo.
